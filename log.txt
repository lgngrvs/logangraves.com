I deleted all the files (in the development branch) today and made a roadmap. My plan is to build the site starting with basic backend features and no styles, then add basic styles, and go from there. The problem with what I did initially -- building the site frontend and then trying to go to the backend -- was that I was trying to fit scripting in around my styling, rather than making elegant styling around the existing scripts. Attempting to integrate the existing folders and pages with all the things needed for the backend was extremely painful. Keeping this in mind, I'm going to try to manage the complexity of this project as best as I can; I am going to try to make the project as simple as possible. (Don't want to have to delete all the files in this project again.) The first step will be setting up the site filesystem, installing relevant packages, etc... I just absolutely despise trying to develop on a Windows computer, because Powershell is trash (i.e. I don't know it) and WSL makes dealing with things (such as installing software) more confusing. The only potential problem I see myself facing in this project is the fact that I have never used a web framework before, and I don't know anything about flask. :)
