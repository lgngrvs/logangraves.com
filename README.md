**My second website design.** Coding my own front- and back-end for the sake of learning, control, and somewhat for enjoyment. Plus, I can leave hidden secrets around much easier if I code it myself. Current design is up @ logangraves.com

The github pages deployment is for the `main` branch, which is the original frontend that I built and then abandoned; active work is only being done in the `flask` branch. I didn't want a new repo, and the existing frontend can give you an idea of what kind of design I like, at least the kind of design that I *liked* (and was able to code, they're two very different things) at the time that I made it. 

Site will run on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Probably deploy through Heroku, but that's an issue for later.

Yes, there will be security issues if I build my own backend. I will think of it as incident-response training.
