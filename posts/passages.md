## Selections from Poetry

### Ozymandias
*by Percy Bysshe Shelley*

I met a traveller from an antique land,     
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone    
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,    
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,    
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,    
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read    
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,    
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;    
And on the pedestal, these words appear:    
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;    
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!    
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay    
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare    
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”    

*From [Shelley’s Poetry and Prose](https://archive.org/details/shelleyspoetrypr00shel)*    
*Norton, 1977*

### Love and Death
*Lord Byron* 


1\.    
I watched thee when the foe was at our side,    
Ready to strike at him—or thee and me,    
Were safety hopeless—rather than divide    
Aught with one loved save love and liberty.    

2\.     
I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock    
Received our prow, and all was storm and fear,    
And bade thee cling to me through every shock;    
This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.    

3\.     
I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,    
Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground    
When overworn with watching, ne’er to rise    
From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.    

4\.    
The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,    
And men and nature reeled as if with wine.    
Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?    
For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.    

5\.    
And when convulsive throes denied my breath    
The faintest utterance to my fading thought,    
To thee—to thee—e’en in the gasp of death    
My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.    

6\.    
Thus much and more; and yet thou lov’st me not,    
And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.    
Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot    
To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.

### Hymn of Apollo
*by Percy Bysshe Shelley*

I.    
The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,    
Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries,    
From the broad moonlight of the sky,    
Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes,--    
Waken me when their Mother, the gray Dawn,    
Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.    

II.    
Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,    
I walk over the mountains and the waves,    
Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;    
My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves    
Are filled with my bright presence, and the air    
Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.    

III.    
The sunbeams are my shafts, with which I kill    
Deceit, that loves the night and fears the day;    
All men who do or even imagine ill    
Fly me, and from the glory of my ray    
Good minds and open actions take new might,    
Until diminished by the reign of Night.    

IV.    
I feed the clouds, the rainbows, and the flowers,    
With their ethereal colors; the Moon's globe,    
And the pure stars in their eternal bowers,    
Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;    
Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine,    
Are portions of one power, which is mine.    

V.    
I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven;    
Then with unwilling steps I wander down    
Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;    
For grief that I depart they weep and frown:    
What look is more delightful than the smile    
With which I soothe them from the western isle?    

VI.    
I am the eye with which the Universe    
Beholds itself, and knows it is divine;    
All harmony of instrument or verse,    
All prophecy, all medicine, is mine,    
All light of art or nature; - to my song    
Victory and praise in its own right belong.

### Ode on a Grecian Urn
*by John Keats*

Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,    
&emsp;Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,    
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express    
&emsp;A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:    
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape    
&emsp;Of deities or mortals, or of both,    
&emsp;&emsp;In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?    
&emsp;What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?    
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?    
&emsp;&emsp;What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?    
    
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard    
&emsp;Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;    
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,    
&emsp;Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:    
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave    
&emsp;Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;

&emsp;&emsp;Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,    
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;    
&emsp;She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,    
&emsp;&emsp;For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed    
&emsp;Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;    
And, happy melodist, unwearied,    
&emsp;For ever piping songs for ever new;    
More happy love! more happy, happy love!    
&emsp;For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,    
&emsp;&emsp;For ever panting, and for ever young;    
All breathing human passion far above,    
&emsp;That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,    
&emsp;&emsp;A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.    

Who are these coming to the sacrifice?    
&emsp;To what green altar, O mysterious priest,    
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,    
&emsp;And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?    
What little town by river or sea shore,    
&emsp;Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,    
&emsp;&emsp;Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?    
And, little town, thy streets for evermore    
&emsp;Will silent be; and not a soul to tell    
&emsp;&emsp;Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.


O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede    
&emsp;Of marble men and maidens overwrought,    
With forest branches and the trodden weed;    
&emsp;Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought    
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!    
&emsp;When old age shall this generation waste,    
&emsp;&emsp;Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe    
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,    
&emsp;"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all    
&emsp;&emsp;Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."

### Song of Solomon (NRSV Translation)

*[Author Unknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Songs#Composition)*


*My beloved is all radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.   
His head is the finest gold, his locks are wavy, black as a raven.    
His eyers are like doves beside springs of water, bathed in milk, fitly set.    
His cheeks are like beds of spices, yielding fragrance.    
His lips are lilies, distilling liquid myrrh.    
His arms are rounded gold, set with jewels.    
His body is ivory work, encrusted with sapphires.    
His legs are alabaster columns, set upon bases of gold. His appearance is like lebanon, choice as the cedars.    
His speech is the most sweet, and he is altogether desirable.    
This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.*  
*(5:10-16)*

## Selections from philosophy

### Culture and Value (Wittgenstein)
> One keeps forgetting to go right down to the foundations. One doesn’t put the question marks *deep* enough down. *(62e)*    

> The labour pains at the birth of new concepts. *(62e)*

### Tractatus Logico-philosophicus (Wittgenstein)

> It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed. Ethics are transcendental. (Ethics and æsthetics are one.) *(6.421)*

> There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical. *(6.522)*

> The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem. (Is not this the reason why men to whom after long doubting the sense of life became clear, could not then say wherein this sense consisted?) *(6.521)*
