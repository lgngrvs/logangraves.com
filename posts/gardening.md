Desc: Some thoughts on what I want this site to be, and how that's reflected in design changes I recently implemented.

Hi! I recently redesigned the site, and am working on some more fundamental/abstract changes too. Read on to find out more.

## What's new

I: 

- changed the font to just one font (spectral) at different weights, (except for code blocks)
- changed the alignment
- removed the nav bar and search box
- removed the footer
- redesigned a bunch of pages
- removed photos and my logo from the front page

I'm still working on further changes.

## What's the goal? 

I'm trying to reorient the website into more of a *digital garden* than a *blog.* This is not a concept I invented, but one I've seen keep popping up in various places and which I think makes sense to me. The idea here is that you're gradually cultivating an interconnected *ecosystem of thoughts* that is in some sense more than the sum of its parts. Essays don't work that well for this purpose *alone* — though they can absolutely be a part of it.

I will still post essays here when I write them — and I will write them —  but what I want is more of a representation of myself than just a place to put longform writing. I want more, smaller pieces, that fit together nicely via hyperlinks — I think that's closer to how I think. If I want this website to *represent me* non-trivially, it feels correct to have it operate on a model that feels closer to how I think.

Also, it's *more fun for me.* This site is very much an art project, a project in self-expression, and when writing feels like a chore I want to still feel like I can add to it. The idea of cultivating a garden is how I want to feel about it: not making herculean efforts, completing heavy lifts — I'd like to save that for when I'm working on research or building something — but instead tending intentionally to the plants.

Hence, I want things to feel *slower*, more *focused*, more exploratory rather than linear. I realized a lot of the features I'd added in the past weren't needed, and didn't have a place in the garden. So I took them out! If I want them back, well, that's what `git` is for.

## Using the internet effectively

I think what I want out of the internet is *initial connections* — the beginnings of great conversations, new ideas, new friendships. That's what it's good at. It's not great at enabling the meaningful substance of those conversations to go well — though it can host content, it's difficult to replicate the depth of engagement you can get in-person. 

So I want to shift my usage of the internet to reflect that. I'm going to start using a pseudonym in various circles, in order to lower the activation energy to posting; I'm not posting inflammatory content or liking anything (too) sus, so I think this is ok. I already inhabit the internet as a real person, so it's not like I'll be giving up existing anonymity; using a pseudonym is just a trick to reduce the barrier to entry for myself.

Anyway, yeah, welcome to the garden! Enjoy your stay.
