# As little design as possible

Desc: Good design is less design.

The indie internet is its own distinct ecosystem. It's the digital world's soft underbelly — amidst the churning mass of algorithmic slop there are scattered oases, peopled by personal websites, anon blogs, side projects, side-projects-that-turned-main-projects; it's organic, hand-made in the way much of the surface-level internet isn't.

One corner of this indie internet[^1] is filled with designers. Designers, being designers, often have very *designed* sites — sites that you might describe as  "attractive", "coherent", "innovative", and/or "intricate".[^2] [Nico Chilla](https://nicochilla.com/) has a grid-based, theme-customizable front page, with subthemes for different kinds of content. You can shuffle the tiles around. [Aaron Z. Lewis](https://aaronzlewis.com/) has a more conventional vertical-style site with lots of scroll animations and hover transitions, extra visual elements like headers with gradient overlays, and like Nico, distinct but connected subthemes on different pages. [Sam Goddard](https://samgoddard.co.uk/) has a one-page site, with a fullscreen page-open animation, a limited monochrome palette, and typography I can best describe as "intense."

I love seeing these sites — and yet, I find that they sometimes make me a bit anxious. I get a similar feeling to the one I get when I'm stressed about something and my room isn't clean — when I have clothes on the floor or need to do my laundry and the disorder weighs on me. It's also the feeling I get when I'm overwhelmed trying to clean out my twitter bookmarks, or when software is running too slowly, or when I'm split-focus trying to talk to someone while a sports game or TV show is going on behind their head. I get a feeling of *disorder*, *distraction*, or *complexity*, despite how intentionally-crafted and clearly-ordered the sites are.

This is kind of an unexpected reaction to have (?) — it's not how I'd imagine myself reacting to well-designed websites, considering the value I ascribe to aesthetics.

Part of it, I think, is that I get caught up in processing the layout and design; I get distracted from the content. I want to focus on one thing, but I'm focusing on two. Obviously, if you're a designer trying to attract clients it makes sense that you'd have a very *designed* website — but if the words you write, the content of your site, is the primary focus, I think having a very *designed* site is a bad thing.

I want to make explicit this idea of *designed-ness*. There can be a lot happening on a website, even if it's aesthetically "minimal" or straightforward — a lot of flourish, a lot of aesthetic intensity. (I use flourish here to mean something like "extra elements that embody and reinforce the aesthetic of the site."[^3])

In this design corner of the internet there's also a common genre of minimal design, with small sans-serif text, elements floating in space, white-on-black. Some examples I have lying around on my design inspiration note: 

- [Matt Cole Wilson](https://mattcolewilson.com/)
- [Ankaph.xyz](https://ankaph.xyz/)
- [Are.na](https://www.are.na/)
- [Abduzeedo](https://abduzeedo.com/node/86403)

I like these sites, but sometimes I can still feel like they're too *designed* for me despite their minimalism. (Note the word "for me" — this is not really a critique of their design choices; it's much more of an expression of personal preference.) Even minimality can be overbearing.

In my experience, aesthetics become easily overbearing; form impedes function. So since I get to design my own space here, I'll take what I'm noticing and try and turn description into prescription: I want to *design without designing.* 

1. I want to do as little "designing" as possible here; I want to make the page attractive and readable, expressive but never overwhelming or complex. I will try not to design. [^4]
2. I want visitors ([Wanderers](/wander)? Garden-goers?) to feel like they're anchored where they are, and to have a strong internal model of the site's architecture.
3. I want the site to feel focused and intentional; Design and flourish should **support and blend with this site's contents, never impede it.**
4. *All of the above apply until vibes are better (?) not to apply them.*

I think this is why the garden metaphor appeals to me. I feel focused and intentional in a garden. I don't get lost, I just wander; I don't get overwhelmed, I just get immersed.

As the amount of content on the site increases, I'll [allow order to emerge from the ground up](/complexity-from-simplicity).

[^1]: Among many other corners. We'll say the internet is a hypercube or something I guess.

[^2]: At some point I'd like to try an analytic philosophy-style deconstruction of the idea of *design* — there is a lot going on there, and I want to try and have better clarity on what I'm talking about when I use the word. But this is not the post for that.

[^3]: Flourish might look different depending on the overarching aesthetic of the page. Aaron Lewis' site has flourish in its css animations and differently-styled subsites; Nico Chilla's site has flourish in its theming too, as well as in the block-shuffling interactivity, the scattered links+arrows, and bitmap-style images.

[^4]: Many other people thought of this before me (Notably industrial designer [Dieter Rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams#Ten_Principles_of_Good_design), also like every minimalist ever)  and it filtered down into my consciousness, making me feel like I figured it out myself. I think this is how understanding good ideas is supposed to feel — comprehending an anti-meme or something. I'll write a blog post about this eventually; for now here's [someone else's twitter thread](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1773524123647439196).
