# Huh? What is the aesthetics page?

The [aesthetics](/aesthetics) page is filled with things I think are good or beautiful. ([These are the same thing](/values) I think.) This is not limited to art; actually, this is mostly stuff that is not art. 

If you're someone I don't know yet, or am just meeting, hi! It's nice to meet you. I want to have a thousand ladders up into my treehouse, so you can come join me however is most enjoyable for you. 

I think that the page is a good representation of myself, insofar as I can actually *represent myself*, whatever that even means. You might be able to sort of get a sense for the kind of person I am just by reading other things that I write, absorbing intuitions about me through my writing style and the small aesthetic pieces that filter through, but I think having a page full of things that I value is a more explicit and very useful supplement. If you like things on the aesthetics page, you might like me! (Take a look also at the [conversation topics](/conversation-topics) post.)

(I also kind of wonder whether the totality of what I value is enough to define my *self*. I don't think that's the case though.)
