> So perhaps the old trinity of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty is not simply the decorous and antiquated formula it seemed to us at the time of our selfconfident materialistic youth. If the tops of these three trees do converge, as thinkers used to claim, and if the all too obvious and the overly straight sprouts of Truth and Goodness have been crushed, cut down, or not permitted to grow, then perhaps the whimsical, unpredictable, and ever surprising shoots of Beauty will force their way through and soar up to that very spot, thereby fulfilling the task of all three.

The [aesthetics](/aesthetics) page is filled with things I think are good or beautiful. ([These are the same thing](/values) I think.) This is not limited to art; actually, this is mostly stuff that is not art. 

If you're someone I don't know yet, or am just meeting, hi! It's nice to meet you. I want to have a thousand ladders up into my treehouse, so you can come join me however is most enjoyable for you. 

I think that the page is a good representation of myself, insofar as I can actually *represent myself*, whatever that even means. You might be able to sort of get a sense for the kind of person I am just by reading other things that I write, absorbing intuitions about me through my writing style and the small aesthetic pieces that filter through, but I think having a page full of things that I value is a more explicit and very useful supplement. If you like things on the aesthetics page, you might like me! (Take a look also at the [conversation topics](/conversation-topics) post.)

(I also kind of wonder whether the totality of what I value is enough to define my *self*. I don't think that's the case though.)

> I think itâ€™s all signaling. People who want to validate an identity as kind and compassionate become altruists. People who want to validate an identity as tough and masculine and hard-headed become vitalists. This is why people bother hitching their star to any philosophy instead of just making money or playing video games or whatever.
