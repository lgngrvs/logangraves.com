(here is a representation of a core thing that I believe.)
(it will almost certainly be revised.) 

There are many meanings to "good." (This is an understatement) 

You can think of some of them like this: 

- **Instrumental**: good i.e. *useful*, a thing is good insofar as it helps you change the world into a state that you prefer
- **Epistemological**: good i.e. (superficially) *true*, as in this thing helps me make more accurate predictions about the world
- **Aesthetic/moral**: good as in, uh... good. Good? Beautiful? Moral?

Aesthetics — judging the beauty of a thing — and ethics are the same thing, in that they are axiomatic value systems. There is no empirical basis for any system of ethics, nor for aesthetics. (The [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem): you can't derive what ought to be from observations about what is.) 

There are surely intuitive things to believe in. I *believe* fully in beauty and in moral values. Some ideas like "human flourishing" are so obviously *good* that it feels like absurd contrarianism to dispute that they are worthwhile ends — and yet, there is no abstract argument that I can make to support the idea that humans achieving a sense of personal meaning is a good thing.

I think this extends to truth as well — though this relation makes sense only in a very abstract way, in that there is no way to derive any first belief. It seems obvious that, well, my subjective experience is in some sense *real*, but I could continue down an [infinite chain](/regress) of beliefs until I reach nothing or I reach a circle. Systems may be internally consistent, sure, but there is no external reference to validate them against.

> "Yes please give me an INFINITE REGRESS OF BELIEFS. Please give me a COHERENT INTERCONNECTED STRUCTURE OF BELIEF that is SELF-JUSTIFYING " 
> 
> -[Statements dreamed up by the utterly Deranged](epistemology)

I am not a nihilist. I am the opposite of the nihilist. Values are just independent of reason.

Here are some things that I think are [beautiful](/aesthetics).
