- reading books
- reading papers
- enjoying my life
	- checking on my friends

	- bouldering
	- playing music
	- (everything else on this page is also enjoying my life, just different or something)
- taking a nap
- starting a book club
- Whatever I am doing at the moment
	- Moments can just be moments in themselves
	- It's not true that every moment needs to be exhausted towards some greater end
	- Moments are ends in themselves if you let them be such
	- Do what you are doing except intentional now
