Hi, I’m Logan. 

## Briefly

I’m an American high school student. My interests encompass every possible subject, but I especially think about philosophy, AI, language, cognitive science, computer science, and mathematics. My current preoccupation involves exploring those subjects, and life in general, as informal and formal systems. 

At school I’m involved in student government, sports, and I run a few clubs in addition to regular classes. I’m always looking to meet new people, so don’t hesitate to reach out!
