Desc: The page about me, Logan, this website's progenitor! Well, really every page on this site is about me â€” that's kind of the point â€” but this one especially so.

Hi there! I'm Logan. ðŸ¦Ž I'm in college doing hard to explain things. There are three things I want out of life: to love, to be loved, and to leave [something beautiful](/aesthetics) behind â€” to contribute to [the human project](/the-human-project).

Some things I care about and enjoy include learning things, hanging out with friends, bouldering, hiking, writing, [un-designing](https://logangraves.com/less-design), composing, learning, and improvising music, the interrobang (`â€½`), and watching [minecraft videos](https://hermitcraft.com/).

If you're interested in doing any of those things with me, I'm available by email at `me at logangraves dot com`  or `@lgngrvs` on most social platforms, though Discord is the only one I really check. (Semi-exhaustive and partly outdated list [here](https://logangraves.com/identities).) This website is [a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to my inbox](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query). You can learn more about me by [wandering this site](https://logangraves.com/wander), or reaching out and having a conversation. I'm happy to try and explain the hard to explain things. :)
