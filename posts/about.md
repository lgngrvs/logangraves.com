I'm an American student, primarily here (i.e. on the internet) to meet people with similar interests and learn from others with expertise -- or, at least, more knowledge than me. I write code and words, both of which you'll find around here. I wrote the server backend (running on a Heroku box) and designed and wrote the frontend of this site from scratch... though that comes with its risks. For more info, and to report any potential vulnerabilities/bugs (cause I am certain there will be some I don't catch) see the [Github](https://github.com/lgngrvs/logangraves.com) or just email me. 

<i>I've gone by various names in the past; for example, some important people in my life know me as Tadhg, but to most people at home (as well as people working in the government identification services) I go by Logan. Call me whatever feels comfortable to you, though -- nicknames or just totally different names are fine! :)</i>
