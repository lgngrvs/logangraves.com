Hi, I’m Logan. 

## Briefly

I’m an American high school student. 

To quote an online friend, "I want to learn everything," though I especially like philosophy, AI, linguistics, cognitive science, computer science, and mathematics. 

I'm really interested in building [social infrastructure](https://logangraves.com/social-infrastructure).

Some other things I like include thinking, writing, reading, bouldering, hanging out with friends, student government, music, and geopolitics.

For info on what I'm up to right now, see [Now](https://logangraves.com/now)
