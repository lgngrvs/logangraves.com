Hi! I'm Logan, an American high school student.

**I want to learn everything**, though I especially like philosophy, AI, linguistics, cognitive science, computer science, and mathematics. (I'm especially versed in philosophy.)

I'm really interested in building [social infrastructure](social-infrastructure) — connecting (and connecting with) people, and building tools to make that easier.

My research interests include: 
- **AI-human analogs**, particularly with regards to *cognitive architectures* (e.g. modeling AI architectures off psychology's models of human cognition)
- Other kinds of interesting techniques (e.g. LLM debate)
- **Prompt engineering** — eliciting responses at the edges of the distribution of outputs (in strangeness, usefulness)
- **Mechanistic interpretability** — especially where mech interp can tell us new information about language or concepts. (It's still insane to me that we can have things like word2vec and semantic similarity metrics.)
- **Moral philosophy and philosophy of language**, especially with regards to what "morality" even looks like in non-human intelligent systems.

I think there's a non-zero likelihood of building something AGI-like in my lifetime, and I want to help make sure that it goes well. These research topics are interesting to me, and are my best guesses at what might be helpful.

Some other things I like include hanging out with friends, bouldering, writing blog posts, web design, writing and playing music, the interrobang (`‽`), and watching [minecraft videos](https://hermitcraft.com/).

For info on what I'm up to right now, see [Now](now).
