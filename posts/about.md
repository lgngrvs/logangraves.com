Hi, I’m Logan. 

## Briefly

I’m an American high school student. 

To quote an online friend, "I want to learn everything," though I especially like philosophy, AI, linguistics, cognitive science, computer science, and mathematics. 

In no real order of importance, my hobbies include thinking, writing, reading, soccer, hanging out with friends, student government, music, geopolitics. *(Hobbies subject to change)*

For info on what I'm up to right now, see [Now](https://logangraves.com/now)
