**Welcome to logangraves.com!** I'm Logan*, an American high school student, and this is my website/blog/coding playground/online identity hub. Here you'll see most of my public writing, both code and words; I wrote this site's back and front-ends from scratch using Python and the web suite, so I've had a lot of fun with the site and its features... and its secrets ;). I explain more in my blog post on the subject, but to make a long story short, it's a learning project for me. Because of its experimental nature (primarily the fact that I wrote it to generate dynamically and have a search function), it's very likely that there are vulnerabilities. If you find one, or if you just want to check out the source, it's on [my Github](https://github.com/lgngrvs/logangraves.com). 

I've gone by various names in the past; for example, some important people in my life know me as Tadhg, but to most people at home (as well as on my birth certificate) I go by Logan. Call me whatever feels comfortable to you, though -- nicknames or just totally different names are fine! :)

## Interests and Topics of Conversation
Since one of my primary goals of having a website is to have a way to start conversations with interesting people, I figured I might include a section on things I'm interested in talking about. If you see something you like, feel free to [contact me](/identities). In fact, please do!

**AI, Math, and Philosophy.** I'm a generalist of the extreme variety. My strongest interest lies in the intersection of philosophy, math, and CS -- namely, AI -- but especially in the philosophy part as I don't yet have the advanced mathematical knowledge required to partake in the other two parts much. I think a lot about questions of ethics and epistemology, which you'll likely see a lot of on this blog; this is because rationally speaking I can't justify any view other than moral anti-realism (i.e. there is no objectively true morality), but yet I *feel* a very strong sense of right and wrong -- and nearly always defer to the latter. I like to try and explore the parts of the mind that aren't rational and objective, and how they interact with my consciousness. [Limerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerence) (broadly, the feeling of love) in particular is an object of my fascination. Theology and Comparative Religion are also really interesting to me because I feel like I experience a lot of religious impulses in spite of being a secular agnostic.


**Linguistics.** Another avenue of exploration into AI for me is computational linguistics: language intrigues me because of how it shapes our world and communication on such a basic level. Conlangs are also a hobby of mine, though I haven't come up with any. I'm a native American English speaker and have proficiency in Spanish and [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona). *sina toki e toki pona la, mi wile e ni: sina open e toki poka mi, kepeken toki pona!*

**Policymaking and Politics.** I'm also intrigued by current events, international relations, and policymaking. I hate engaging in partisan U.S. politics but believe it is a *very* necessary evil. I'm a huge fan of public transportation, especially trains (in fact, my views on public transportation are objectively correct), but will leave the rest of my political views up to obvious inference. I'm also interested in rationality (in the [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bJ2haLkcGeLtTWaD5/welcome-to-lesswrong) sense) and effective altruism, which I try to have inform much of the above. 

**Computer Science.** I have some knowledge of CS; I write in Python (I used the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.0/)/Jinja2/Werkzeug suite after it was recommended to me by a friend) and am relatively proficient in HTML/CSS/JS. I know some very basic BASH just to navigate the terminal. In the future I'm looking to go deeper into the basics of computers: I hope to learn some lower-level languages (including Assembly just for funzies haha), though I need a project to use them in first. I've thought about participating in a computing olympiad but I don't know anyone to do it with and I think it would be too time-consuming to do so. 

**Body, Mind, and Soul.** I believe that the rational mind, the body, and the "soul" (meaning spirituality or something along those lines) are pillars to a good life. Much of my time is spent playing soccer and volleyball, since both are year-round for me. I like to talk about professional soccer ('football', sorry), especially the EPL and Champions League. I'm also interested in physical fitness and health -- diet, effective training, etc. -- as well as meditation and related activities, like prayer. I really like traveling and being in nature, so I love hiking and would some day like to learn to sail. 

**Video Games.** I don't really play video games anymore except as a social activity. Not because I don't want to, I just... don't. I still like them, though. I loved Overwatch and Minecraft when I was in middle school, so I guess those are still my favorites. I've also played a nonzero amount of Eurotruck Simulator, weirdly enough.

**Music.** I play the piano, guitar, and my vocal chords, the latter two much less seriously than the former. I do some music production in Ableton and Maschine, and I've been a keyboardist and singer "in" a few "bands" that never actually had any commitment involved. We'll see, though. I enjoy songwriting, music theory, and making playlists. I like most genres of music -- my favorites are indie, folk, rap, metal, and rock, but I'll listen to nearly any genre as long as the music doesn't suck. 

That's most of it, I think. Once again, if any of these things, or a post on my blog, or a project that I'm working on, interests you, please [contact me](/identities)!
