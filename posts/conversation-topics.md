Desc: Things we could talk about :)


- *Most important to me: "what's your story" (i.e. like what's your life like, how'd you end up in [x place I met you], what do u think about the future and your place in it)* 

**Philosophy**

- Can you systematize ethics
- Thoughts on analytic philosophy vs. continental philosophy 
- What is the point of philosophy?
- People i can probably talk about, in sort of descending order of competence: wittgenstein, sartre, de beauvoir, camus, rorty, kant, plato, nietzsche, maybe russell, maybe aristotle and a little aquinas
- Are aesthetics and morality the same thing (i think so) 

**Literature**

- Why do we read literature? (literature being some sort of writing that is valued for more than just entertainment/fluff)
- Why do we write literature? is it related to why we read it, or is it a distinct motivation? what implications might that have for consuming literature? 
- Wtf is going on with finnegans wake. he can't be just trolling right? right???
- Does it matter how the author *intended* you to interpret a work of art? are all interpretations valid, even politically inconvenient ones?
- Jorge Luis Borges  :) 

**Myths and anthropology**

- Religion as a pre-packaged sense of meaning for everyone
- Religion as a memetically-evolved pre-packaged sense of meaning for everyone
- Co-opting or respecting religious aesthetics: is "holiness" worthy of respect? is it worthy of subversion? 
- Pantheons and stories: greek, roman, egyptian, aztec, inca, scandinavian, indian, chinese, etc.
- Thoughts on ritual as a good in itself

**AI+Alignment**

- What is intelligence
- What does "aligned ai" even look like? ai with common sense? a benevolent god? 
- Alignment policy: how do we balance safe development of ai with risk of state monopolies on ai? 
- Is "objective morality" just an effective coordination mechanism between agents? is supermoral ai a meaningful idea ([banger](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/umJMCaxosXWEDfS66/moral-reality-check-a-short-story))

**AI-Human Analogs**

- Why are LLM prompting techniques useful on humans
- Do inner and outer alignment have corresponding analogs in humans? (human alignment theory) 
- What is your value function? what is my value function? is it some weird multidimensional piecewise function? don't tell me it's a continuous high-dimensional surface

**Language**

- Sapir-whorf hypothesis
- Toki pona; nahuatl; sign language; lojban
- What is language?

**Psychology**

- Freud, Lacan, Jung, etc.: are these theories actually useful?
- Is *modern psychology actually useful*?? I mean yes it has predictive power but maybe not explanatory power 
- Gender as a fundamental template for relationships with the people you interact with

**Self+Emotions**

- What does "I" refer to
- Where does the self reside, if it resides anywhere?
- What is love/what are the constituent things bundled into "love"? is it really just evolutionary chemical soup? 
- What does it mean to be "rationalist"? is that even a good thing to pursue?
- Experiences with psychedelics -- i   unfortunately do not have any, so you'd have to tell me about urs :P

**Math and stuff**

- GÃ¶del and Tarski
- Category theory
- What even is math? The study of abstract structures?

**Programming**

- What do you actually use functional programming for i don't get it and am stubbornly unwilling to actually take time to figure it out
- How do you get complex computers from electrical circuits? this isn't even, like, emergent behavior it's just crazy levels of abstraction
- Are computers basically magic? do we live in an era of magic
- Turing machines, computability theory, lambda calculus (I know of but not really *about* these things; why are they useful?) 

**maybe technical stuff; I'm still skilling up but**

- Thoughts on, idk, transformers vs. mamba? better architectures? are there systematic judgments about what makes better architectures or are we just flailing around
- Building RAGs (I mention this because I want to build my own)

**(Geo)politics**

- American hegemony and its consequences
- Voting reform 
- Can nationalism be wielded safely? can any allegiance be accepted wholly while still being critical of the institutions you accept along with it?
- Security and defense policy; the military-industrial complex 
- Where is democracy headed

**History**

- Basically history of any culture/civilization (I know significant american history but not much else with meaningful depth, please tell me about stuff you know) 

**Other** 

- Community building: 
- What is "culture" (in a community, in a society)
- Interesting projects we/I/you could build
- Personal knowledge management
- Integrating llms into life effectively
- Semiotics?
- Antimemetics????

(incomplete list obviously)
