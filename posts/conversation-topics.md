Desc: Things we could talk about :)

The most interesting conversation topic to me is "what's your story" — what's your life like? How'd you end up in *[x place I met you]*, what do you think about the future and your place in it? 

I'm trying to do a better job of avoiding the tendency to outsource my identity to things external to me, like knowledge or awards. Common interests are great places to start, but I think the person behind them — that person's unique mix of influences and experiences, heuristics, etc. — are what makes the conversation importantly distinct from, say, a speech-to-text conversation with an LLM.

Well, anyway. 

**Philosophy**

- Can you systematize ethics
- Thoughts on analytic philosophy vs. continental philosophy 
- What is the point of philosophy?
- People I can probably talk about, in sort of descending order of competence: Wittgenstein, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Camus, Rorty, Kant, Plato, Nietzsche, maybe Russell, maybe Aristotle and a little Aquinas
- Are aesthetics and morality the same thing (I think so) 

**Literature**

- Why do we read literature? (literature being some sort of writing that is valued for more than just entertainment/fluff)
- Why do we write literature? is it related to why we read it, or is it a distinct motivation? What implications might that have for consuming literature? 
- Wtf is going on with Finnegans Wake... he can't be just trolling right? right???
- Does it matter how the author *intended* you to interpret a work of art? Are all interpretations valid, even politically inconvenient ones?
- Jorge Luis Borges  :) 

**Music**

*see also [Music I like](/music)*

- Meaning in music: is it different from language?
- *Meaningless* music, emotionally evocative without an intended concrete meaning (e.g. Ravel's *Pavane*)
- *Gaspard de la Nuit* (I am so down bad for Ravel) 
- Love in harmony (*Liebestraum*)
- The deconstruction of music as an art form; music that makes you suffer (e.g. 100 gecs *xXXi_wud_nvrstøp_ÜXXx*)
- Melodic metal, the aesthetics of screaming lol (Loathe, *Screaming*)

**Myths and anthropology**

- Religion as a pre-packaged sense of meaning for everyone (inc. community, self-transcendance/meaning, ritual, epistemic grounding, tradition/culture)
- Religion as a *memetically-evolved* pre-packaged sense of meaning for everyone
- Co-opting or respecting religious aesthetics: is "holiness" worthy of respect? Is it worthy of subversion? 
- Pantheons and stories: Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Inca, Scandinavian, Indian, Chinese, etc.
- Thoughts on ritual as a good in itself

**AI+Alignment**

- What is intelligence
- What does "aligned ai" even look like? AI with common sense? A benevolent god? 
- Alignment policy: how do we balance safe development of AI with risk of state monopolies on ai? 
- Is "objective morality" just an effective coordination mechanism between agents? Is supermoral AI a meaningful idea ([banger](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/umJMCaxosXWEDfS66/moral-reality-check-a-short-story))

**AI-Human Analogs**

- Why are LLM prompting techniques useful on humans
- Do inner and outer alignment have corresponding analogs in humans? (human alignment theory) 
- What is your value function? What is my value function? Is it some weird multidimensional piecewise function? Don't tell me it's a continuous high-dimensional surface

**Language**

- Sapir-whorf hypothesis
- Toki pona; nahuatl; sign language; lojban
- What is language?

**Psychology**

- Freud, Lacan, Jung, etc.: are these theories actually useful?
- Is *modern psychology actually useful*?? I mean yes it has predictive power but maybe not explanatory power 
- Gender as a fundamental template for relationships with the people you interact with

**Self+Emotions**

- What does "I" refer to
- Where does the self reside, if it resides anywhere?
- What is love/what are the constituent things bundled into "love"? is it really just evolutionary chemical soup? 
- What does it mean to be "rationalist"? Is that even a desirable thing to pursue?
- Experiences with psychedelics -- I unfortunately do not have any, so you'd have to tell me about yours :P

**Math and stuff**

- Cantor (set theory, diagonalization!!)
- Whitehead and Russell (type theory, *Principia Mathematica*, the urge to find real foundations)
- Gödel and Tarski (Incompleteness and indefinability in strong formal systems)
- Category theory
- What even is math? The study of abstract structures?

**Computer Science**

- What do you actually use functional programming for I don't get it and am stubbornly unwilling to actually take time to figure it out
- How do you get complex computers from electrical circuits? this isn't even, like, emergent behavior it's just crazy levels of abstraction
- Are computers basically magic? Do we live in an era of magic (yeah)
- Church and Turing (Computability, Lambda calculus, Church-Turing thesis, Halting problem)

**Maybe technical stuff; I'm still skilling up but**

- Thoughts on, idk, transformers vs. mamba? better architectures? are there systematic judgments about what makes better architectures or are we just flailing around
- Building RAGs (I mention this because I want to build my own, even though context windows are getting big enough that they probably will be pointless pretty soon)

**(Geo)politics**

- American hegemony and its consequences
- Voting reform 
- Can nationalism be wielded safely? can any allegiance be accepted wholly while still being critical of the institutions you accept along with it?
- Security and defense policy; the military-industrial complex 
- Where is democracy headed

**History**

- Basically history of any culture/civilization (I know significant american history but not much else with meaningful depth, please tell me about stuff you know) 

**Other** 

- Community building: 
- What is "culture" (in a community, in a society)
- Interesting projects we/I/you could build
- Personal knowledge management
- Integrating LLMs into life effectively
- Semiotics?
- Antimemetics????

(this is an incomplete list obviously and it will be continually expanded)
