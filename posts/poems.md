Desc: Some of my favorite poems.

## Ozymandias
*by Percy Bysshe Shelley*

I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br>

## Yes 
*by Gregory Orr*

Burden and blessing --<br>
two blossoms<br>
on the same branch.<br>

To be so lost <br>
in this radiant wilderness.<br>

## Hymn of Apollo
*by Percy Bysshe Shelley*

I.<br>
The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,<br>
Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries,<br>
From the broad moonlight of the sky,<br>
Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes,--<br>
Waken me when their Mother, the gray Dawn,<br>
Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.<br>

II.<br>
Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,<br>
I walk over the mountains and the waves,<br>
Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;<br>
My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves<br>
Are filled with my bright presence, and the air<br>
Leaves the green Earth to my embraces bare.<br>

III.<br>
The sunbeams are my shafts, with which I kill<br>
Deceit, that loves the night and fears the day;<br>
All men who do or even imagine ill<br>
Fly me, and from the glory of my ray<br>
Good minds and open actions take new might,<br>
Until diminished by the reign of Night.<br>

IV.<br>
I feed the clouds, the rainbows, and the flowers,<br>
With their ethereal colors; the Moon's globe,<br>
And the pure stars in their eternal bowers,<br>
Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;<br>
Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine,<br>
Are portions of one power, which is mine.<br>

V.<br>
I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven;<br>
Then with unwilling steps I wander down<br>
Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;<br>
For grief that I depart they weep and frown:<br>
What look is more delightful than the smile<br>
With which I soothe them from the western isle?<br>

VI.<br>
I am the eye with which the Universe<br>
Beholds itself, and knows it is divine;<br>
All harmony of instrument or verse,<br>
All prophecy, all medicine, is mine,<br>
All light of art or nature; - to my song<br>
Victory and praise in its own right belong.<br>
