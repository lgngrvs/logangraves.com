## Ozymandias
*by Percy Bysshe Shelley*

I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br>

## Yes 
*by Gregory Orr*

Burden and blessing --<br>
two blossoms<br>
on the same branch.<br>

To be so lost <br>
in this radiant wilderness.<br>
