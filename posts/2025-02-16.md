<span class="dropcap" letter="A">A</span><span class="smallcaps">t this moment, admidst the slow march of short days</span> in the South Bay's damp winter months, I'm trying to give all of myself away. In lieu of a <code>now</code> page which I don't feel like updating, I'll speak but briefly: I'm throwing myself into the things that I do — doing fewer, and giving them as much as I can. To elaborate too much further on specifics would be letting all the energy out, as I frequently and unfortunately do, but I <i>have</i> found some new love that I'd enjoy passing on. For one, I feel like I've fallen in love with math for the first time in my life. I suspect, though, that it may be one of those loves that you realize was shallow only in retrospect — in retrospect, when you have felt something deeper. (I have not reached anything even near to the depths yet. Exciting!) Also, I recently went swimming on a frigid morning; I was in the pool with a wintry drizzle, and I realized I think I love swimming too. All sorts of surprises this quarter!</p>
