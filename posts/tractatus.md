In lieu of a proper treatment of Wittgenstein's *Tractatus Logico-philosophicus,* I'll drop a couple details here. Eventually this page will be a full explication on why I think the book is fantastic. For now I will leave you with, "this book meaningfully changed my life on a day-to-day basis and completely shifted my philosophical outlook. I regard it as the most personally important book I have ever read." 

Not only is the form of the book super cool, it plays with self-reference and... agh, I won't spoil it for you. Just go read it, or dm me about it (contact info at the bottom of my [about page](/about)) if you don't feel like reading it or something.

(I'd note, though, that a part of why this book was so important for me may have been that I read it relatively early in my life â€” intellectual life, at least. I am very confident it is cool even if you have done a lot of philosophy, but if you don't have the peculiar missing pieces that I had at the time and are not me in general, I guess, I don't know what kind of impact it'll have on you.)

How I did it: 

1. Have some background in philosophy I guess, I can't remember how much I had but it wasn't *that much* 
2.  Look at the book for a couple minutes and puzzle at it; don't expect to understand it, be curious
3. Read or watch something that gives you context, basic ideas, and frames the jargon to make interpretation easier; I prefer lectures, I recall [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1RPRp5bDgg) being exceptionally good though I don't remember exactly 
4. Go back to the *Tractatus* and give it a full run-through; you can probably skip a lot of the technical formal logic that is in the middle. 
Also, check out Gavin Leech's [Showing Over Saying](https://www.gleech.org/tractatus).

**TL;DR:** watch a lecture or two (or read something equivalent I guess) before you read the book; this will probably give you enough context to take the book from meaningless and impenetrable to mostly cool and interesting. 

(That's how it worked for me I guess.)
