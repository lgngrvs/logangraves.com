## I. Against going to high school

There is a direction that my thoughts keep bouncing in — have kept bouncing in for years — that I want to talk about. It's something like, *you could be so much more if you just thought a little harder and tried a little harder.* Some part of me constantly imagines ways my life could be different.

> Logan, why haven't you come up with interesting original computer science research yet? 
> Why haven't you dropped out of school to take a weirder, more interesting life path? 
> Why haven't you found the most interesting, most unconventional, most enlightened, strangest possible way to live your life?
> Why aren't you optimizing better?

I'm aware of my own agency. I know that I can *just do stuff*. This is hard to cope with in high school, because most high schools aren't designed for kids who want to shape their own paths — especially schools that serve a large student body. Larger schools develop a bureaucracy of their own, a "way of doing" that is rarely supportive of students who want to go beyond it. Special requests are denied; challenges to tradition are treated with exasperation and contempt, not enthusiasm.

School is at the same time *kind of boring*. The class content isn't really  challenging; sure, you might have to put time in to study for tests or write good papers, but that's usually not because things are conceptually difficult; you're just not optimally efficient. Sometimes you need to memorize. Sometimes you need to go gather sources, and get distracted. The bottom line is that if you want a challenge, you have to find it on your own.

But doing that is difficult, too, because school requests that you spend at least 6 hours on campus, then a couple hours of homework, if you're taking advanced classes. Doing all the stuff that you "need to do" in order to succeed (according to the school) leaves you with little time or mental effort left. Your alternative is to take incredibly, mind-numbingly easy classes with people who will clown on you for reading books.

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Literally you lol</i></p>

(Which, like, if that's you, have fun idrc but hating books will not take you very far. There's lots of cool stuff in books.)

Aye, you can take somewhat interesting classes and have lots of work, or take mind-numbingly boring classes and have time to learn other stuff on the side.

But wait! Isn't there a secret third option?

## II. Just drop out lol

I'm lucky to know some people with unconventional backgrounds. I knew someone who dropped out of high school to work on a Minecraft mods platform. I knew someone who was [unschooled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unschooling), didn't go to college, who just said fuck it and got a job at a supercomputing company. I knew someone who got money from Effective Altruists and hired a bunch of tutors with his friends, basically making his own school.

They remind me that I don't just have to sit in class and stare out the window wishing the teacher would let me open my laptop. 

I know how to learn. I know how to teach myself; that's how I've gotten by all these years. Couldn't I teach myself so much more effectively if I just *didn't go to high school?* Like I could just read math textbooks, do the exercises, and probably learn it better than I would in my classes, faster. Here's the preliminary plan: 

1. Drop out
2. Get a... homeschooling permit? or something? 
	- if parents don't want to get homeschooling permit, get [emancipated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_of_minors) or something
3. Teach myself everything interesting and become cracked
4. Idk, get a job somewhere that doesn't care about degrees? Or just start a business of my own. I'm pretty smart, I could probably make a reasonable amount of money doing something right?

Ooh, I could just go work in a national park for a year and become cracked by reading a ton of math textbooks. Or I could become a digital nomad and exploit wealth inequality in Thailand to live for incredibly cheap. It couldn't be that hard, right? And life would be so interesting!

That is usually about as far as the planning process goes, if it even gets this far. 

By default, I picked the "take work-heavy 'advanced' classes" option because it was well-defined and people thought I was *the kind of person who did that,* and because I liked the validation of easy number grades, and because the alternative was too aversive or poorly-defined. This means that I don't really have the mental energy to figure this plan out, because I have to finish this essay. Or do my summer homework. Or... idk, but *there's always something more to do*.

Plus, I don't know if I... *actually want to*? It's scary. My parents might be unreceptive, and then I have to figure it out myself. It's a lot of work for a poorly-defined idea. And I'm kinda tired. Planning stuff is hard. I don't know what I'd do with myself. I need to figure that out before I can drop out of school. But there's never enough time to figure that out, so I don't drop out of school.

Instead, I choose to find the local minimum. I pick the things in my environment that seem as close to interesting or worthwhile as I can: building a friend group. Becoming the Varsity soccer captain. Giving a TEDx talk. Winning the election for Student Body President. Having the highest GPA in school. Applying for summer programs. It all seems fun and challenging and meaningful at first, and then I start doing it, and then just keep doing it because it's "what I do," and because achievement motivation says I should.

It's like I'm stuck in this bowl, and I can't see anything above my y-level. I think I can see other places with steeper gradients, places with deeper bowls — life seems better over in that bowl where I took the leap for that National Park Ranger job —  but I can't really see the hill I need to climb to get there, at least not with the amount of mental space I have remaining after all that damned work that I signed myself up to do voluntarily. (Nor would I have the willpower, consistency, discipline, or something to climb the surface anyway.)

Yup, looks like I entered the bowl when I enrolled in high school. I got nerd sniped, or rather, got status-anxietied and achievement-motivated into doing all these things that I'm not sure I actually care about.  I don't feel at home with my soccer teammates, or with my student council peers; why do I even do this?

But I just keep grinding, because it's "what you do" and it's too steep to climb out, find another path. Months, semesters, years pass by. Suddenly it's college applications season. I committed to this high school thing, I guess I'll go to college too. At least there the classes will be interesting. 

Shit, I should have figured out how to game the system. Agh, I should have thought a little harder freshman year. Should have become a nationally-ranked Squash player advocating for LGBTQ+ rights in the Squash community. I should have cold emailed sixteen obscure biology professors at UC Berkeley and spent my summer conducting publishable research in a fertility clinic. Whatever, it's too late now. I take the SAT, write my essays, send everything in. I guess we'll see. 

Fast forward eight months. It's May 2024. I'm... incredibly happy with the person that I am? I'm going to a school I'm incredibly happy with, studying in a program better than anything I could have dreamed of for myself? I'm proud of the work that I've done and the life that I've led for the last four years of my life?

*Huh?*

Maybe I've been looking at this all wrong.

## III. Guh, dumbass, you were actually optimizing well all along

The above is the narrative I trapped myself in for years. Now that I'm leaving, I can recognize that it's leaving out something really important.

Aye, high school is not the most interesting academic time of my life. It's not the place where I would go to learn everything, or to find my intellectual soul mates, or to actually contribute to science. I spent much of those four years of my life grinding, doing homework, commuting, writing emails, managing tasks. Academics were a time sink.

*All of this I knew going in.* When I was applying to high schools, I had the following choices: 

1. The only selective public school in San Francisco, known for being an academic pressure-cooker. Would spend my formative high school years in a place where everyone is suicidal
2. Catholic school, where everything is, like, fine I guess. Tuition is pretty reasonable, there's education there and it's, like, good ish. Would spend my formative years in a place where people are just... really normal?\* And go to mass every couple months.
3. Secular private school expensive enough that my family would have no money left for college if I attended. Would spend my formative years with all the rich people idk
4. (don't go to school? I didn't consider this an option at the time tho and my parents probably wouldn't have let me)

[*]: Poor choices by the school board in SF drove a large contingent of secular families who would have attended regular public school, including mine, to Catholic schools, where tuition was not literally price of college and where the Catholicism was mostly low-key. Demographics at my Catholic school were basically the same as the rest of SF, just with the ends cut off.

I thought about this for a while. Education at the secular private schools was more flexible, more progressive, with smaller classes and quirkier teachers. Was it worth it, though, if it meant I grew up in a bubble? If it meant leaving college with many times the debt?

I decided I could wait to become academically cracked — that's something I can do anytime in my life. I'll have 70+ years or something to be academically cracked. Plus, it's not like the education was horrible or anything, it was just not quite as cool as what the private schools offered.

In return, I decided, I'd get something more valuable: I get to grow up around normal people. I get to learn how to lead people who aren't like me — I get to learn how to navigate cultural gaps, how to interact with people operating under a totally different paradigm (e.g. some of the athletes); I get to learn social skills, I get to avoid that uber-rich bubble. I was aware that high school would be a critical period for development (though I didn't use those exact technical terms until I took AP Psychology) and I decided it was better to go to the place I'd be most likely to grow up to be well-adjusted and normal.

I'm really happy I did. Because while it *was* difficult, it *was* grindy, it was a local minimum, **most of the ways that I suffered ended up forcing me to become awesome** — forcing me to become **someone I'm really excited to be.**

I think the path I took is actually much closer to the *global optimum* than I thought.

**We can look at how I spent my time** — the extracurriculars and stuff — not as just "getting status anxiety'd" or whatever into doing stuff I didn't care about. In fact, it wasn't that at all. I did some shit that was really fucking hard for me. But I did it because it seemed *valuable,* and I grew because of it. 

Let's take a look at soccer, for example. Freshman year I was arguably the worst player on the freshman team, after more than half the freshman tryouts got cut. I resolved to be the varsity team captain by senior year, just to prove that I could do it.

I did early-morning and afterschool lifting sessions. I worked out 7 times a week some weeks, just because that's how the schedule worked out playing for club and school. I convinced coaches to let me move to a club with higher-level teams in order to get upward mobility, and then kept grinding hoping they'd move me up to a better team. (They never did.)

I never fully fit in with any of the teammates I played with; I never really meshed with the culture that surrounded the sport. I did my best to make friends with people who valued almost none of the things I cared about — teammates who didn't give a shit about learning or doing cool things, who just wanted to survive the day and go to a Friday night party, who'd smoke before the games. It fucking *sucked.*

Junior year I made varsity, played one game as a co-captain, and then lost my armband because I collapsed under the pressure. My teammates didn't trust me, — I didn't like really them or feel like I fit in with them, so I never did — and I lost confidence in myself.  I declined. I rarely played a full game, even a full half. 

Senior year I almost didn't play. My mom had to convince me to go to tryouts just to see how things shook out. But something felt different now as a senior — as the older kid. I made varsity and I figured my shit out. I figure out how to lead a team, if awkwardly at times — my cultural fit wasn't always there, which was why we had two captains. But I tried to help the team develop culture, and I served as a role model for younger kids, who I knew I could influence.

Our season was kind of shit. We had our 3rd varsity head coach in three years. We placed near the bottom of the table. But we had our moments — we beat our crosstown rivals in an unforgettable game. I scored an unbelievable goal, the only goal I scored in at least half a decade — I'll never forget doing that.

And after all the pain and suffering, all the awkwardness, all the grinding,  I fulfilled that dream I had as a freshman — and hopefully helped some freshmen like me get on the path to fulfilling theirs. I made it through to the other side more powerful, more confident, more knowledgeable about what I care about, how to lead, how to navigate. I know I can do hard shit, miserable shit. With that knowledge comes a sense of great power. The suffering *did* build character.

And likewise, for the rest.

## IV. Suffering and beauty 

I kind of hated high school. I was kind of miserable for most of it. 

Academically, I wasn't challenged enough — so I learned the best way for me to self-teach.

Socially, something always felt missing, no matter how many friend groups I made. There was no one who I felt at home with intellectually — but that forced me to keep searching in other places, to experiment, and led me to PAIR, which meaningfully altered the course of my life positively and gave me access to a ton of amazing new friends.

I went through a couple extremely painful friendships and relationships. Two of my first close friends in high school broke apart our friend group and cut me out because they were too obsessed with each other to realize what was happening — and by experiencing friends who didn't care about me, I learned how to care for others. I went through a long-term relationship that slowly faded because neither of us had the guts (or I at least the attraction) to progress — and from that I learned what relationships *are* and *aren't* supposed to feel like, and how they're supposed to progress. And I fell in love with the wrong person — yeah, like love love, writing sonnets and shit — and it destroyed me. But that experience taught me more about what I need, and how to care for others, than I could possibly imagine.

I came to terms with myself — I mean, I'm of course still figuring things out, but I'm no longer afraid.

For every unfulfilled desire, every miserable moment, I've gotten something beautiful in return — I've learned how to love. I've learned how to care, and to communicate, and to lead, and to survive.

And at the end of it all, I've become someone better than I could even have envisioned freshman year.

I did everything I could — varsity captain, student body president, research at stanford, summer scholarship for AI at cambridge, top GPA. I have smart, interesting friends at approximately every major university in the country, plus many outside of it. I know love, and I know how to love. and to care, and to communicate, and to lead, and to survive when necessary.

And there was a light at the end of the tunnel, even on top of all this. 

Because I got into three Ivy Leagues, the most competitive liberal arts college in the US, and every UC, and had the privilege of saying no to them all. In the fall I'm going to attend arguably the best university in the world, especially for what I'm studying — [the world's dream school](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2017-03-30/this-is-americas-dream-college) —  for a major more perfectly suited to me than anything I could have dreamed of. I'm going to get to spend the next four years of my life plugged into the world's technological revolution. All of this without bullshit, without wasting my life on fake resume items and  collegemaxxing — no hooks, no blown-up fake diversity, no obscure athletic recruitment or big donor legacy status. I literally just did what seemed valuable, and then wrote essays that said true things.

At the end of it all, *I don't need to be better.* If I can, that's great — and I'll never be able to stop feeling driven to improve. But the person that I am today is someone I'm proud to be, and I can just keep doing what I'm doing. 

There was, after all, a plan. I used to think that looked like a complex, explicit, detailed document, describing every part of my life, every protocol, every system. In reality, it's called values. 

With a family I had a family that loved me and gave me the foundations for my success, I followed my values. I did what felt valuable, what felt right; I held onto my integrity, and got through shitty situations with my head high knowing I did everything I could. And (in return, perhaps) the world gave me what I needed — luck? skill? love? I don't know, but it worked out far better than could be expected from coincidence. 

Following values works. 

With all of this said and done, some things I learned in high school, all of which I'm still working on living by:

1. Follow what feels true and authentic, and difficult. You know what that feels like. The world will give you what you need if you do.
2. You can only really love someone if you love them unconditionally.
3. You can only really love the world if you love it unconditionally. 
4. It is ok, perhaps good, to suffer; the way that you bear it will define who you are. Do everything you can and then leave the rest up to (fate or whatever). 
5. Relationships are simultaneously that deep (in importance and complexity) and not that deep (in terms of what to do). **Communicate** clearly and simply, about everything (well, to a reasonable extent obv)
6. Details matter, a lot: how you carry yourself, how you listen (or choose not to); whether you let them in to the conversation or shut them out whether you send a text reaching out, whether you make sure they're ok. 
7. It is almost never worth it to keep your feelings silent.

8. Build friend groups when you don't have them.












### V. Morally and intellectually lucky? 

- how did i get these values? 
	- lucky
- how did i get the brain good enough to support my efforts? 
	- lucky
- what did I do to deserve this?







But I could be better. If I just planned a little better, tried a little harder, my life could be more interesting. If I was just a little more creative, a little more efficient, a little more consistent, I would be unstoppable.

**These are thoughts I have, but don't embrace.**

If I look back at freshman year, I am almost exactly the person younger me wanted to be — I've accomplished all the things. I've developed as a person. I have the highest GPA in the school, I was the varsity soccer captain and the student body president. I conducted AI research at Stanford and flew to Cambridge University on scholarship for an international AI program. I have smart, interesting friends at approximately every major university in the country, plus many outside of it. I know love; I've had long relationships, loved and had my heart broken.

I got into three Ivy League schools and every UC, and got to say no to them all. In the fall I'm going to attend arguably the best university in the world — [the world's dream school](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2017-03-30/this-is-americas-dream-college) —  for a course of study more perfectly suited to me than anything I could have dreamed of. I'm going to spend the next four years of my life plugged into the world's technological revolution.

This local optimum is actually, probably, the best possible situation I realistically could have accessed.

And the kicker: I didn't do any of the things I imagined I'd need to for this to happen. No hyper-organized plan, no college advisor following me for 4 years helping me curate my resume. I rawdogged college admissions — no hooks, no blown-up fake diversity, no obscure athletic recruitment, legacy status, or inauthentic resumemaxxing. I literally just did what seemed valuable, and then wrote essays that said true things.

Maybe the way I'm living life is actually great? Maybe I'm actually on the path to a meaningful and successful life?

- I *feel like* I’m stuck in local minima.
- I’m not living to my potential. I go down the bowl to success in high school
- am i Really? I mean, stanford is arguably the best university in the world, for the thing I’m studying. Maybe I should just be patient and walk my own path.
- Am I not maturing fast enough?
- Agency — constraining action space 
- my problem is that I don’t *care*
- But wait, I am literally by all outside metrics in the perfect situation. I am literally in the ideal state if I asked me freshman year.
	- Is this a bad thing? Shouldn’t my goals be evolving? 
	- Didn’t I do, like, the bare minimum? 
	- I feel like I’m getting away with being intelligent and mediocre. I haven’t done anything, like, *hard* in the sense that I didn’t know how to do it. 
	- Succeeding in a well-defined environment is a trap; the world is not a well-defined environment
- I just followed My values and did my best — the things that made me successful are innate ?
	- Is it unfair that I’m smart and good? 
	- eh is this true l? Yeah lol I think so 
	- ability = responsibility 
	- Mom says it’s reincarnation
	- Everyone comes into the world with work to do
- so it’s actually fine to keep doing what I’m doing. when the time comes I will know — I will keep trying, keep being attentive. 
	- But things are *working.* 
	- I don’t need to live the life other people live — I should live my own, the one that I want to live. The one that’s fascinating and joyous
		- Bleg still remembering the idea of taking meetings in the bathroom lol
- I’m doing things that I care about. It’s occasionally heavy lifting —most of the time it’s medium and I just keep going
	- Taking good things from shitty situations
