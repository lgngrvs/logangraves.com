Updated *late May, 2024*. 

> There is no choice but to become cracked in everything at once. How difficult of an endeavor that seems to be! — yet, it is the only worthwhile path upon which to travel.

In mid-may 2024 I graduated high school. Not coincidentally, I started to feel *hungry* again, like I did when I was younger, the feeling of wanting to contain the whole universe inside of me, to be bursting open with multitudes. I'm making up for lost time!

I continue to feel like I'm stuck straddling two worlds. Perhaps they will unite at their limits.

I'm probably going to start a web design agency. Email me if you're interested in being an early client.

Currently reading: 

- *Introduction to Computing Systems* by Patt and Patel — textbook that takes you from transistors up the levels of abstraction to high-level programming.
- *What the Buddha Taught* by Dr. Walpola Rahula, an introduction to Theravada Buddhism. Rahula was a monk and a professor of History and Religions at Northwestern.
- Various stories from *Collected Fictions* a compendium of short stories by Jorge Luis Borges translated by Andrew Hurley
- *Bach, Beethoven, and the Boys* by David Barber, a short book on the history of western music.
- Various transformers resources & papers
