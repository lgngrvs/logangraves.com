Here's what I'm up to as of late June, 2023: 

**Enjoying summer.** I'm on summer break! I'm trying to pick up bouldering with the time off. I have a weirdly high number of great opportunities to meet cool people right now, and I'm doing my best to utilize them.

**Research internship at Stanford.** I'm part of an AI research team for  Stanford Compression Forum, working on the intersection of the Humanities and STEM.

**Philosophizing with Î¦A.** I'm leading an experimental, online philosophy association for students in high school or early college. Reach out if you're interested, it's pretty chill!

**Preparing for this fall.** I've got some time on my hands to prepare for this fall, when I'll get to lead my school's student government. 

**Reading.** Currently working (slowly) through Richard Rorty's *Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity*, a little book on Wittgenstein by P.M.S. Hacker, and *The Name of the Wind* by Patrick Rothfuss. I just finished *Cloud Atlas* by David Mitchell and re-read Descartes' *Meditations on First Philosophy*

**Music.** Getting better at improv on piano and guitar. 

**Learning about cars.** I got a very old car. I'm learning how it works, and how to fix it. I looooove thermodynamics :D

**Writing.** I like to write about what I'm thinking about, and sometimes I publish it here. I'm slow to add posts to this blog, though; I want to make sure anything that goes up here is representative of me. I will often post drafts of varying quality on my [drafts site](https://drafts.logangraves.com) to get feedback on them. *(Disclaimer: drafts may be easy to misinterpret, and they are not necessarily representative of my thoughts.)*
