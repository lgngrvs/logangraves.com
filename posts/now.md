Here's what I'm up to as of May 2024: 

- Enjoying the last vestiges of high school
- Trying to [solve all the problems in my life](open-problems)
- Learning for the sake of learning.

## Coming up 

**Near future** (high confidence)

- Graduating high school
- Spending the summer learning as much as possible, having ideas, and traveling with my best friend
- Starting my undergraduate degree in [Symbolic Systems](https://majors.stanford.edu/majors/symbolic-systems) at Stanford 

**Future** (medium to high confidence)

- Attending a rat camp as a JC/returner
- Conducting research

**Far future** (medium to low confidence)

- Working in AI 
- Maybe grad school?
- Saving the world lol
