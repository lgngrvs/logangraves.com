Here's what I'm up to as of *late May, 2024*. 

I have now graduated high school! I'm figuring out my summer plans still, but I'm hoping to get a simple part-time job and spend the rest of my time learning. 

I feel *hungry* again — I want to learn everything again, and I'm enjoying the process of doing so. I haven't felt this joyful in a while. God I love learning stuff

Currently reading: 
- *Introduction to Computing Systems* by Patt and Patel — extremely fun textbook that takes you from transistors up the levels of abstraction to high-level programming.
- *What the Buddha Taught* by Dr. Walpola Rahula, an introduction to Theravada Buddhism. Rahula was a monk and a professor of History and Religions at Northwestern.
- *Bach, Beethoven, and the Boys* by David Barber, a short book on the history of western music. 
- Various stories from *Collected Fictions* a compendium of short stories by Jorge Luis Borges translated by Andrew Hurley
- Various transformers resources & papers
