Here's what I'm up to as of early December, 2023: 

- **College applications.** Yeah, it's that time of year. Most of my free time is spent on college apps (updates to this site will be sporadic)

- **Independent research.** I'm working on a research project on polysemic word embeddings in language models.

- **Music.** Messing around on the piano.

## Next

Here's what's coming up for me: 

**Near future** (high confidence)

- Finals
- Finishing college apps

**Future** (medium to high confidence)

- Going back to a rat camp
- Going to college 

**Far future** (medium to low confidence)

- Getting a degree in Cognitive Science
- Working in AI 
- Saving the world lol
