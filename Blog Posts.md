**essays**
- on status anxiety/being late to the party
	- status anxiety is unfounded, but it's a signal of growing (reconcile these two things) 
	- *being late to the party b/c i got there myself*
- what is my value function? on alignment
- rage for order
- ~~open problems~~
- goals for 2024
- follow-up on college resolutions post
	- Should make an "edge" here
- fragment: monk mode/"deep work" is what matters, not systematicity or comprehensiveness. 
	- in other words, *doing shit,* *building shit* is the most important thing.
- parables on love
- cantor, godel, tarski
- that insane long political culture essay
- mystic's manifesto
- lingustic inflation
- on secret societies
- how i build x thing
- against annotation
- What should I work on? (list of projects)
- everything is actually just applied rationality
	- philosophy, science, literary analysis, etc.
	- illusory one-dimensionality. 
	- creative spirit
	- and, like, mysticism
- **How to have ideas** ^f552dc
	- Read stuff intently, ask lots of questions — learn the answers or figure out how to answer those questions yourself 
- What is a [[Schellling points]] (with ref to [[Proj.Social infrastructure|Social infrastructure]])



**site organization**
- add fragments, notes, etc. (in addition to post types and stuff?)
	- also "edges" or something
		- I saw someone's pkm work like this
- rather than having lots of short pages? have longer, denser pages?
- *Publish blog posts as in-progress notes from my obsidian?*
- ok, actually it might be a problem to do this — i need to remember to git commit and everything.
