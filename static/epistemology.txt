STOP DOING EPISTEMOLOGY
• BELIEFS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GIVEN FORMAL ACCOUNTS
• YEARS OF SEARCHING yet NO REAL-WORLD USE FOUND for going deeper than "IT FEELS TRUE I THINK"
• Wanted to go deeper anyway for a laugh? We had a tool for that: It was called "THEOLOGY"
• "Yes please give me an INFINITE REGRESS OF BELIEFS. Please give me a COHERENT INTERCONNECTED STRUCTURE OF BELIEF that is SELF-JUSTIFYING " - Statements dreamed up by the utterly Deranged
LOOK at what EPISTEMOLOGISTS have been demanding your Respect for all this time, with all the language & logic we built for them (This is REAL Epistemology, done by REAL Epistemologers):
