## a long and complex search query

When you have a personal website, there are a bunch of cool things that you can do with it. You can write essays. You can post your code. You can post your keys. You can post all sorts of things. You can write fun little programs. You can style it however you want.

What would you like to do with all these things? You could try to do it for money or fame -- but if you're planning to do those things, this is not for you. Today we're making a _personal_ website: a website not for profit, not for fame, but for expression. We're making _a long and complex search query_, to spoil the point a bit.

This might not feel like an intuitive way to think about a website, so I'll try to elucidate a bit before we proceed.

I think I first saw this idea in [an essay by Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query) -- his original articulation was only about blog posts, but I think it's still highly relevant.

The way that I think about the personal website is that it's a long, complex search query for the right people. It's a magnet for people who fit your aesthetics, who share your interests, who, to put it short, care about the things that you care about.

## structure of the class

1. The website: what is it? what can you do with a website? (10 min)
    - fundamental way that I think about website is, website as search query.
        - website is personal expression. a collection of things you like, a collection of things you think about
        - but why do you make this public?
            - to enter into the hypertext edifice. to be linked to by others, but primarily, to link to things yourself.
        - in essence, it is a _complex search query_: you are putting out calls to the internet, saying, "this is who I am! come be friends with me!" and when people think things are interesting, they can talk with you about them.
        - logangraves.com/about can give anyone an introduction to who i am, what i'm interested in, what I care about. this makes new friendships extremely easy. I have lost count of the number of friendships that I have developed out of my website.
        - i've written essays that people have told me have "shaped their worldview", and other people's writing has shaped mine. the whole idea of the website as a search query
    - what kinds of things can you do with a personal website?
        - show links
        - lists
            - blogs you like
